## R Markdown with a Word Template

This is an R Markdown document that knits to a Word template. Using this feature you can control the appearance of your documents. 

The `flextable` package will format R data frames into tables. For more information on `flextable` see: https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/index.html

```{r flextable}

summary_table <- iris %>% 
  group_by (Species) %>% 
  summarise (`Sepal Length` = round (mean (Sepal.Length),1),
             `Sepal Width` = round (mean (Sepal.Width),1)
             ) 

summary_table %>% 
  flextable()
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=2}
summary_table %>% 
  ggplot (aes(x = Species, y = `Sepal Length`)) + 
  geom_col (fill = "blue") + 
  theme_minimal()
  
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
